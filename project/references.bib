  abstract  = {With the increasing demand and popularity in the usage of cloud computing, there has been a necessity to prevent common attacks and security threats to cloud computing services. The consumers of cloud services are constantly concerned about the cyber-security risks, data loss, and slowdown of services. With the advancement of machine learning techniques, learning-based methods for security applications are gaining tremendous popularity in the field of literature. Over the past few years, ML techniques have been shown to prevent as well as to detect security attacks on the cloud. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive and systematic literature review on the use of ML in cloud security and its applications and techniques to prevent security issues on cloud computing. We further evaluated relevant research and studies and divide them into three main categories: (1) The security threats and attacks on cloud computing, (2) Types of ML technologies used to prevent security threats, (3) Evaluating the results and discussing the performance outcome of the models. The extensive review and findings proposed in this paper can contribute to further enhancements and improvements in cloud computing and security issues with the use of machine learning algorithms. Moreover, it will provide the basis for other researchers to contribute new ideas and enhancements in achieving reliable and safe methods to access cloud computing applications and avoid any potential security issues.},
